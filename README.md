# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation
For this assignment we had to implement Kmeans, and Logistic Regression from scratch using Python then run them on the provided data set. I utilized numpy and pandas in my solution. The data set had to be be preprocessed heavily to get it into a state of use. Look at the jupyter notebook for a detailed overview of the project.
